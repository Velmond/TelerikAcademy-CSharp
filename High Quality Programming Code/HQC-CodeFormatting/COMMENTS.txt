01. Formatting C#

    I used StyleCop as well as JustCode as guides to format the code of this project.
    I have purposely not added documentation headers as StyleCop's default settings recommend as that is not the purpose of this homework but the next one.

02. Formatting JavaScript

    I used the JSLint.NET extention for Visual Studio and JSHint as well as http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml as guides to format the code in this file.

XX. Additional

    The folder "PowerCollections" is needed for the first task as this is where the Wintellect.PowerCollections namespace (for the EventHolder class) is referenced from.
